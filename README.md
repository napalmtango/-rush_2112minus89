<b>CSS Refactoring of School Project</b><br>
Initial stage of refactoring a school project originally developed in the first few weeks of web development course.
Objetive is to utilize SASS partials to organize css. The original project's css file was overly complicated and long.
Additionally refinements/comments to html and css will be made as needed. Planned improvements to page will be made utilzing 
JavaScript with the possible additions of jQuery and/or React. For now the priority is with css clean-up.
